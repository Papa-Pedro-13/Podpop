              <p class="article__text">Welcome to our Return page, where you'll discover everything you need to know
                about the return process. We've streamlined the process to make it easy and convenient for you, allowing
                you to complete it online with just a few additional details.</p>
              <p class="article__text">Upon initiating the return via the provided link, you'll be able to purchase and
                download the shipping label directly from our website. It's important to note that unregistered returns
                may lead to processing errors, and please remember that the shipping label is only valid for <b>5
                  days.</b></p>
              <p class="article__text">The cost of the return label may vary depending on the country. For the
                Netherlands and Belgium, the fee for the shipping label is <b>5.5 euros</b>. For other countries, the
                return
                label cost will be displayed when you start filling out the return form.</p>

              <p class="article__text">Our return policy is simple and straightforward. If a product doesn't meet your
                expectations, <b>you have 30 days from receiving the order</b> to initiate a return. Please keep in mind
                that
                return processing may take up to 14 days. Also, retaining the shipping receipt is crucial, as we
                cannot
                be held responsible for the package until it reaches our warehouse.</p>
              <p class="article__text">All items must be returned in their original condition, including any attached
                labels and tags. Unfortunately, due to hygiene considerations, items without tags or those that have
                been washed, used, or altered from their original state cannot be accepted for return.</p>

              <p class="article__text">In the case of a defective item, our standard return rules apply. After
                confirming the defect at our warehouse, we will fully refund the order cost along with the return
                expenses. However, if the product shows signs of use, washing, staining, or damage, it won't qualify for
                a return and will be sent back to you.</p>
              <p class="article__text">Please note that we do not cover return costs; you are responsible for purchasing
                the return label. We kindly ask you to minimize returns to lessen the environmental impact of
                transportation.</p>
              <p class="article__text">Should you encounter any issues with your product, please don't hesitate
